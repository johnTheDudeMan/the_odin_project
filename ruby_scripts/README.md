# The Odin Project

These are some solutions to projects that I completed from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) course. I am using this course to train myself in becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.

**Please Note:** I do apologize for the organization of this repository. I unfortunately linked my solutions back to The Odin Project's website, and do not want to break those links by reorganizing now. Please use the bellow to navigate through the different sub projects.


### Simple Server and Client
###### Ruby

A Ruby socket server that processes GETs and POSTs from a command line browser.

### Etch-a-Sketch
####### JavaScript

Remember the classic Etch A Sketch toy? This version I built in JavaScript with a few more bells and whistles. 

Test [Etch-a-Sketch](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://github.com/johnTheDudeMan/the_odin_project/blob/master/etch_a_sketch/index.html) in your browser.

### Event Manager
###### Ruby

Practice File input/output with Jumstart Lab's [EventManager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html) project. Uses data from a CSV file to contact a remote server. Uses ERB for templating. 

View repository [here](https://github.com/johnTheDudeMan/the_odin_project/tree/master/event_manager).


### Micro Blogger
###### Ruby

Uses the Twitter API to send tweets, send direct messages to all user's friends, and shorten URLs using Bitly.

View repository [here](https://github.com/johnTheDudeMan/the_odin_project/tree/master/microblogger).


### Mastermind
###### Ruby

A code-breaking game for two players or one player vs computer played on the command line. A codemaker makes a code and the other player has to guess the code within 12 tries. Hints are given for each incorrect guess. The computer uses hints and typically guesses the code correctly (without cheating).

### Hangman
###### Ruby

Comand line version of the classic game, Hangman. You also have the ability to save and load game. This project was good for practicing with serialization and working with files.
